desktopconfig
=============

Contains some conky dotfiles and a few bash scripts which create the desktop shown
here: http://i.imgur.com/XO7ap8P.png

Wallpaper: http://www.made-in-england.org/images/city_desktop.jpg

Notes:

- You must install conky to set up this desktop with all the dotfiles as is.
  You can install conky from here: http://conky.sourceforge.net/
  or from your package manager.
- The weather.sh script will not work out of the box. It needs an API key
  from WeatherUnderground and for you to fill in the variables which correspond
  to your city and state of residence.
- Running the weather.sh script will create two files in the ~/bin/ directory
  If you'd like to change the location of these files, you can fill in a
  different directory in the weather.sh script. Deleting these files is not
  recommended as this will prevent conky from updating as time goes on.

If you'd like to tell me anything about this, feel free!
